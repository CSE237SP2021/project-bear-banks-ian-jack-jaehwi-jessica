**Please see README.txt in the README branch to see the progress report for iteration 1.**

**Class**: CSE237

**Group members**: Ian Youth | Jessica Wu | Jack Cho | Jaehwi Park

**Program Name**: Bear Banks

**Coding Language**: Java 

**IDE**: Eclipse

**Interface**: Text-based; command line application

**Overarching Project Summary**: "Bear Banks" will essentially be an ATM machine with which customers and employees can interact and execute various bank-related tasked. Our **target audience** would theoretically be (1) people who would like to bank with us, (2) people who work for Bear Banks, and (3) people who currently bank with us (3/29 note: additionally functionality to be added).

**Key Features**: Bear Banks will do anything that an ATM might normally do. The following is a working list of Bear Banks' capabilities:
    
    CUSTOMERS will eventually be able to do all of the following:
        1.) Open an account (everyone currently does this first)
        
        2.) Set log in credentials (Name; Pin number)
        
        3.) Change their pin number
        
        4.) Set security questions
        
        5.) View their account balance
        
        6.) Withdraw cash from their account
        
        7.) Deposit cash to their account
        
        8.) “Print” a receipt (after withdrawing/depositing cash)
        
        9.) Set up multiple accounts and transfer money in between accounts
        
        10.) Cash checks
        
    EMPLOYEES will eventually be able to do all of the following:
        1.) Lock the ATM for use
        
        2.) Close a customer’s account
        
        3.) View the balance of a customer’s account
        
        4.) Reset or clear security questions with respect to a customer's account
